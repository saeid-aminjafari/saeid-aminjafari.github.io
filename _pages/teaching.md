## Courses:

**Advanced Hydrology 7.5 credits (Stockholm University)**
Teacher assistant in Hydro-Geodesy. In this module, I taught students how to generate interferograms and interpret the fringe patterns relating to hydrologic connectivity and water level changes. I used ISCE software in this course.

**Water Management and Pollution, 15 credits (Stockholm University)**
Teacher assistant in optimization. In this module, students learned how to model the most efficient way to mitigate pollutants' flow in a basin. I used the Pyomo model in this course.

**Tellus I – Physical Geography, 15 credits (Stockholm University)**
The course deals with hydrology, mass movements, rivers and flooding, oceans, coastlines, groundwater, the atmosphere and climate, arid regions, geomorphology, Quaternary geology, and global changes.

**Other**
InSAR (Doris and StaMPS software), Oceanography, Field surveying operations, Route surveying, MATLAB programming for geomatics students, (National Cartographic Centre of Iran (NCC), Tafresh University, & Daneshpajoohan Institute of higher education)

## Master's Students:

**Jenny Frank (Stockholm University)**
Thesis title: Monitoring Water Area and Hydrological Connectivity in Wetlands Using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Time series

**TAHMID IMRAN IMON (Stockholm University)**
Thesis title: A modelling approach to study hydro-dynamics of Ciénaga Grande de Santa Marta, Colombia using ANUGA and InSAR
