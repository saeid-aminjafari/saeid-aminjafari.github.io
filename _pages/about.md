I am a hydro-geodesist with a knowledge of hydrological sciences, particularly surface hydrology and wetlands. I have been working as a PhD student in the unit of Water, Permafrost, and Environmental Systems at Stockholm University (SU) since 2019. Prior to that, I did my undergraduate and graduate studies in geomatics and marine geodesy, at the Universities of Tafresh and Tehran in Iran, with a strong focus on both theories and applications of remote sensing. Prior to my PhD journey, I gained valuable insights and expertise in the offshore and onshore industries such as hydrographic and land surveying. However, it was during my PhD that I truly discovered my passion for research, which allowed me to develop my own ideas.

PhD Thesis
======
It was on my very first flight to Stockholm that the high density of surface water bodies over Sweden attracted my attention. That visual inspection from the airplaneâ€™s window, I count as my first attempt at remote sensing of the Swedish lakes. My PhD research has led to five manuscripts (1 published and 4 under review) that four of which are included in my thesis addressing three over-arching objectives.
The first two objectives relate to a hydrologic analysis of changes in water occurrence and water levels and their main drivers in the face of climate change. The third objective seeks to tackle remote sensing methodological challenges in hydrologic applications.
Besides research articles, I am developing a comprehensive data product of water levels in approximately 1000 lakes in Sweden, which I expect to be of high interest to the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute, among other stakeholders.
