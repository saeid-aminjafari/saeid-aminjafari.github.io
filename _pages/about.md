Like many teenagers, I was full of dreams about my future but had no idea what I wanted to do with my life when I was 18. I always thought my dad was a great success, so I decided to go to university and study a similar field as my dad’s, i.e. geomatics and surveying (2006). Studying geomatics was fun, but I did not know working in geomatics is not as fun as studying it, just until I started working as a land surveyor in the last year of my studies (2010). I had to carry one of those army-green cameras and walk around (quite a lot) and measure distances and elevations on land. Sometimes in the cities and streets, sometimes inside the buildings, and sometimes in nature and deserts. Soon, I got bored of that job, however, I kept doing it for so many years and even during my master’s studies (2014), but I needed *money* to pay the bills! The picture below clearly shows that I was not happy doing the same thing day in and day out and I did not like my measuring device! I look so much better when I am happier and older (look at my profile picture on the top left)!

# Grad studies and the Next Job
Since I did not find my passion on land and did my master’s in marine geodesy (2011), I decided to work as a marine surveyor or hydrographer on the sea! It was a bit more fun and adventurous! I got to fly on a chopper (Helicopter), onboard offshore oil rigs, and sail with massive boats! I also did a lot of marine research. Images below show a gas platform on a calm day in the Persian Gulf (can you see the flare?) and one bathymetric image of an offshore gas platform (the four legs of the platform is visible in the middle, some pipeline or debris, and some holes that probably gas bubbles come out of them).

# Moving to Academia
Well, that job did not amuse me either. Besides, working in the oil industry was upsetting, seeing oil spill with the naked eye and ruining the sublime beauty of the sea was not fun at all. However, I realized that a bit of research activity that I had during that job was cool. So, I decided to do a PhD (2019). I liked water, but not as much as you find in the sea, maybe a lake was enough for me. So, hydrology became my topic, and as I like to go high, satellite remote sensing became my tool. It was on my very first flight to Stockholm that the high density of surface water bodies over Sweden attracted my attention. That visual inspection from the airplane’s window, I count as my first attempt at remote sensing of the Swedish lakes. Read about my PhD research here. What I like the most about writing scientific proposals, and applying for grants and funding is the competitive part of it, I feel like I am alive. I also get a feeling of fulfillment and accomplishment when I do research for the good (saving the planet).

# Other Interests
I love comedies (standup and tv shows), and my all-time favorite comedians are Larry David, Ricky Gervais, and Luis C.K. I quote too way often from Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm! So, I get along well with those team members who respect wood!

I also love football (soccer), I even had a team in the Swedish amateur league (Korpen) for two seasons (2021-2022 & 2022-2023). Although we never came first, we had a good team.
