# Undergrad Studies and the first job
I enrolled in an undergrad program in Geomatics and surveying (2006). I started working as a land surveyor in the last year of my studies (2010) and measured distances and elevations on land. I did that job even during my master’s studies (2014).

# Grad studies and the Next Job
I did my master’s in marine geodesy (2011) and worked as a marine surveyor or hydrographer onboard offshore oil rigs and ships! I also did marine research. Images below show a gas platform on a calm day in the Persian Gulf (can you see the flare?) and one bathymetric image of an offshore gas platform (the four legs of the platform are visible in the middle, some pipeline or debris, and some holes that probably gas bubbles come out of them).

# Moving to Academia
I started my PhD studies in 2019 in hydrology and satellite remote sensing and graduated in 2023. Read about my PhD research [here](https://saeid-aminjafari.github.io/academic/). I like to see the impact of my work on society and I strive to achieve meaningful and helpful results in my research. I love communication and being with people. You need to ask this from my colleagues and students. I have mentored master's and junior Ph.D. students. According to them (both in the evaluation forms and in person), I am supportive of my colleagues and students and they feel comfortable turning to me to get help and advice. This feels so great that I can't describe it.

# Other Interests
I love comedies (standup and tv shows), and my all-time favorite comedians are Larry David and David Mitchell. I quote too way often from Seinfeld, Peep Show, and Curb Your Enthusiasm! So, I get along well with those team members who respect wood!

I also love football (soccer), I even had a team in the Swedish amateur league (Korpen) for two seasons (2021-2022 & 2022-2023). Although we never came first, we had a good team.
