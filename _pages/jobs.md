## Land Surveying (2010-2014)

In the last year of my bachelor's studies (2010), I started working as a land surveyor. This means that I had to carry one of those army-green cameras and walk around and measure distances and elevations of land. I had to walk a lot, sometimes in the cities and streets, sometimes in the buildings, and sometimes in nature and deserts. Soon, I got bored of that job, however, I kept doing it for so many years and even during my master's studies (2014), but I needed **money** to pay the bills! The picture below clearly shows that I was not happy doing the same thing day in and day out and I did not like my measuring device! I look so much better when I am happier and older (look at my profile picture on the top left)!

## Marine Surveying and Hydrography (2014-2019)

Since I did not find my passion on land and did my master's in marine geodesy, I decided to work as a marine surveyor or hydrographer! It was a bit more fun! I got to fly on a chopper (Helicopter), onboard offshore oil rigs, and sail with massive boats! I also did a lot of marine research. I learned how to communicate with stakeholders and companies and clients, write professional industrial proposals, deliver Daily Progress Reports (DPRs), and even draft the final reports. As a surveyor, I scanned the sea bottom by processing sonar data and multibeam echosounder images, made bathymetric charts, and navigated drilling rigs from one location to another with the help of DGPS devices and heavy-lift ships. Images below show a gas platform on a calm day in the Persian Gulf (can you see the flare?) and one bathymetric image of an offshore gas platform (the four legs of the platform is visible in the middle, some pipeline or debris, and some holes that probably gas bubbles come out of them).
