## Gains
The most valuable asset that I earned during my professional experience was learning how to communicate with stakeholders, companies, and clients, write professional industrial proposals, deliver Daily Progress Reports (DPRs), and even draft the final reports. As a surveyor, I scanned the land and the sea bottom by processing GPS, total stations, and sonar data, and also multibeam echosounder images. I made topography maps, and bathymetry charts, and navigated drilling rigs from one location to another with the help of DGPS devices and heavy-lift ships.
