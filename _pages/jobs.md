In the last year of my bachelor's studies (2010), I started working as a land surveyor. This means that I had to carry one of those army-green cameras and walk around and measure distances and elevations of land. I had to walk a lot, sometimes in the cities and streets, sometimes in the buildings, and sometimes in nature and deserts. Soon, I got bored of that job, however, I kept doing it for so many years and even during my master's studies (2014), but I needed **money** to pay the bills! The picture below clearly shows that I was not happy doing the same thing day in and day out and I did not like my measuring device!
